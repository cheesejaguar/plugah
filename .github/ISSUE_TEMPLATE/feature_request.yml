        You are Claude Code working in the "plugah" repository (Multi-agent orchestration system).

        Feature:
        - [Replace with the desired behavior and constraints]

        Instructions:
        - Load the repository in your vibecoder of choice (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code + Continue, Zed, etc.).
        - Create a new branch from `main`:
          - Branch name suggestion: `feature/<short-slug>`
        - Implement the feature:
          - Keep changes minimal and focused. Follow patterns in `plugah/`, `tests/`, and CI.
          - Add/adjust tests under `tests/` to cover new behavior.
          - Update `README.md` and CLI help with examples/flags.
        - Validate locally:
          - Run `pytest` (mock mode where applicable).
          - Sanity-check CLI: `plugah-demo --help`.
        - Commit, push, and open a PR targeting `main` with a concise summary.

        - [ ] Feature implemented and covered by tests
        - [ ] Docs/examples updated
