      label: Problem Statement
      description: Describe the problem or need this feature would address.
      placeholder: |
        Currently, there's no way to pause execution mid-flight and resume later.
        This makes it difficult to handle long-running tasks that might span multiple sessions.

      description: Describe your proposed solution or feature.
      placeholder: |
        Add checkpoint/resume functionality:
        - Save execution state after each task completion
        - Provide a `--resume <checkpoint-id>` flag
        - Store checkpoints in `.runs/{project_id}/checkpoints/`

      label: Alternatives Considered
      description: What alternatives have you considered?
      placeholder: |
        - Using persistent background jobs (too complex)
        - Breaking into smaller budget chunks (loses context)
        - Manual state management (error-prone)

      description: Describe your specific use case for this feature.
      placeholder: |
        I'm using Plugah to generate large codebases that take hours to complete.
        I need to be able to pause overnight and resume in the morning.

      description: Any thoughts on how this could be implemented?
      placeholder: |
        Could extend the existing state persistence:
        - Add checkpoint_id to BoardRoom state
        - Serialize executor state including partial results
        - Add resume() method that rebuilds from checkpoint
