source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev,demo]"

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pre-commit install

# For web development
cd web/frontend
npm install
cd ../..
```

### Running Tests

```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, please use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) and include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
- Relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) and include:

- A clear problem statement
- Your proposed solution
- Alternatives you've considered
- Use cases and expected impact

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Simple issues good for beginners
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### Development Workflow

1. **Find or create an issue** for what you want to work on
2. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
5. **Write or update tests** for your changes
6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Run tests and linting** to ensure everything passes
8. **Commit your changes** using semantic commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve bug in executor"
   git commit -m "docs: update README"
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** with your changes (if significant)
2. **Ensure all tests pass** and coverage doesn't decrease significantly
3. **Update documentation** including docstrings and README if needed
4. **Fill out the PR template** completely
5. **Link the related issue** in your PR description
6. **Request review** from maintainers
7. **Address review feedback** promptly
8. **Squash commits** if requested before merging

### PR Title Format

Use semantic prefixes:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or corrections
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for all functions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use ruff for linting and formatting
- Docstrings for all public functions (Google style)

Example:
```python
def calculate_budget(
    total: float,
    policy: BudgetPolicy = BudgetPolicy.BALANCED
) -> BudgetModel:
    """
    Calculate budget allocation based on policy.
    
    Args:
        total: Total budget in USD
        policy: Budget policy to apply
        
    Returns:
        BudgetModel with calculated caps
    """
    # Implementation
```

### TypeScript/React Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint and Prettier for formatting

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Examples:
```bash
feat(executor): add checkpoint support for long-running tasks
fix(budget): correct soft cap calculation in CFO
docs(api): add examples for BoardRoom methods
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use pytest for Python tests
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Structure

```python
def test_feature_normal_case():
    """Test normal operation of feature"""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert

def test_feature_edge_case():
    """Test edge cases and boundaries"""
    pass

def test_feature_error_handling():
    """Test error conditions"""
    with pytest.raises(ExpectedError):
        # Code that should raise
```

## Documentation
